My Name is Raul Sosa. I am a graphic designer with a background in the fine arts. With years of experience on my hands I can do just about anything you throw at me. As it should, I have experience using the Adobe Creative Suit on both a Mac and Windows platform.
My skills range from traditional paintings such as oils and acrylics to graphics and web design. I am knowledgable of HTML/CSS, PHP and 3D Studio Max.
<br/>
<br/>
Starting in 2006, I have participated in various art expos and events throughout New Jersey which includes the Du'cret Art Show, the Brotherhood Sisterhood contests, Hudson Cradle Contest, The Yam contest and many more.

You may be asking what makes me so special from the rest. Well, I have the ambition and drive to create design. I don't just design I live it. Art is my passion, my will and lifeline. But enough about that, what do you say to visiting some of my work? I invite you to take a look at my online portfolio at www.friedarts.com or behance.net/rsosa12. If you like what you see please leave a message, suggestions are always welcomed. Or perhaps you may prefer speaking in person? In that case you are always welcome to give me a call or e-mail. Please refer to my resume for more contact information.
<br/></br/>
Thanks, 
<br/>
Raul Sosa
